  Q1: Load the naive fibonacci and a print method for a series of fibonacci.
At which method call did the interpreter paused for some time?
*) 

let rec fib n =
  if n<=1 then 1
  else (fib(n-1))+(fib(n-2));;

let print_fib () =  
  for i=1 to 40 do
    let _ = Printf.printf "Fib(%d) = %d \n" i (fib i) in
    flush(stdout)
  done;;  
 


(* 
  Q2: Load a more efficient version of fib2 below together with its
	print method. Take note of which call first has an integer overflow.
*)
let fib2 n =
  let rec aux n =
    if n<=0 then (1,0)
    else let (a,b)=aux(n-1) in (a+b,a)
  in fst(aux n);; 

let print_fib2 () =
  for i=1 to 60 do
    let _ = Printf.printf "Fib(%d) = %d \n" i (fib2 i) in
    flush(stdout)
  done;;  


	
(* 
  Q3: To avoid integer overflow, you can either use the big_int module or
	the following num module .
	
	  type num = 
    |	Int of int
    |	Big_int of Big_int.big_int      //Like a linked list of integers
    |	Ratio of Ratio.ratio

  http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Num.html
	
	Rewrite fib3 to use num type so that integer overflow does not occur.
	
	From top-level, first #load "nums.cma";; into memory.
	After that, open Num;;

  You may need to use:
	  num_of_int : int -> num
	  string_of_num : num -> string      //to print
		+/ : num -> num -> num		
		
	Run print_fib3 to get the first 100 fibs.
	
*)

open Num;; 
 
let fib3 (n:int) : Num.num =
  let rec aux n =
    if n <= 0 then (num_of_int 1, num_of_int 0)
  else let (a,b) = aux (n-1) in (a +/ b) 
  (* Need to use +/ as it's the addition operator for num *)
  in fst (aux n);;

	(* failwith "to be implemented using Num.num_of_int and Num.(+/)" *)

let print_fib3 () =
  for i=1 to 100 do
    let _ = Printf.printf "Fib(%d) = %s \n" i (Num.string_of_num(fib3 i)) in
    flush(stdout)
  done;;  




(* 
  Q4: Implement fibonacci as a tail-recursive method with two
      parameters, initially denoting fib(0) and fib(1).
      Is its computational behaviour different from a Loop?

*)
let fib4 n =
  let rec aux i r1 (* fib i*) r0 (* fib i-1 *) =
    if i=n then r1
    else aux (i+1) (r1 + r0) (* fib i+1 *) r1 (* fib i *)
    (* failwith "to be implemented with recursive (aux (n-1))" *)
  in aux 0 1(* fib 0 *) 0 (* fib -1 *);; 

let print_fib4 () =
  for i=1 to 60 do
    let _ = Printf.printf "Fib(%d) = %d \n" i (fib2 i) in
    flush(stdout)
  done;;  



(* 
  Q5: You have been asked to implement a list of factorials.
	A naive way of implementing it is given below. The naive
	algorithm has O(n^2) complexity.
	
  Can you write a more efficient tupled recursive method to do this
  in O(n) time?
	
  To avoid integer overflow, change it to use the num type.

let rec fact n =
  if n==0 then 1
  else n * (fact (n-1));;

let rec factlist n =
  if n==0 then []
  else (fact n)::(factlist (n-1));; 
 
let factlist (n:int) : Num.num list =
  failwith "to be implemented using tupled recursion and Num library"

*)

let rec fact n =
	if n==0 then num_of_int 1
	else (num_of_int n) */ (fact (n-1));;

let rec factlist n =
	if n==0 then []
	else (fact n)::(factlist (n-1));; 

let cnv xs = List.map string_of_num xs;; (* to print out the big num *)
(* Call as cnv (factlist 60);; *)

 
(* let factlist (n:int) : Num.num list =
	failwith "to be implemented using tupled recursion and Num library" *)	



(* 
  Q6: Consider a function to enumerate all prefixes of
      a list of elements. Such a function can be written
      using recursion, as follows:
  
*)
let enum_prefix xs = 
  let rec add e xs =
    match xs with
    | [] -> []
    | r::rs -> (e::r)::(add e rs) in
  let rec aux xs =
    match xs with
    | [] -> [[]]
    | e::es -> 
      let rs = aux es in
      [] :: (add e rs)
  in aux xs;;

  let enum_suffix xs =
    let rs = List.rv xs in                (* Reverses the list *)
    let ans = enum_prefix xs in   
    List.map List.rev ans;;           (* Reverses each element *)

enum_prefix [1;2;3;4];;

enum_prefix [4;-1;2;-9;3];;


(* 
  Q7: Using enum_prefix, write a function
      that would find the largest prefix in a given list.
   What is the time-complexity of this method?

*)
(* sum might be wrong..trial and error to get it right!*)
let rec sum xs =
  match xs with
  | [] -> 0
  | x::xs -> x + (sum xs)

let choose_max xs1 xs2 =
  let s1 = List.sum xs1 in
  let s2 = List.sum xs2 in
  if s1 < s2 then xs2
  else xs1

let rec find_max rs = 
  match rs with
  | [a] -> a
  | b::ds -> choose_max b (find_max ds);;

let max_prefix xs = 
  let rs = enum_prefix xs in
  find_max rs 
  (* failwith "find largest seq in rs";; *)

(* 
  Q8: Without using enum_prefix, write a
      more efficient max_prefix2 method that would
      return an identical result as max_prefix.

      Using recursion to implement your new method.
      Compare and contrast between these two 
      methods for computing max_prefix.

*)

let rec max_prefix2 xs = 
  failwith "return largest prefix of xs";;
